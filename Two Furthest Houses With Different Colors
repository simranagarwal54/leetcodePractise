Two Furthest Houses With Different Colors

There are n houses evenly lined up on the street, and each house is beautifully painted. You are given a 0-indexed integer array colors of length n, where colors[i] represents the color of the ith house.

Return the maximum distance between two houses with different colors.

The distance between the ith and jth houses is abs(i - j), where abs(x) is the absolute value of x.
